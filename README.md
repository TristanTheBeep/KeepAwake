# ðŸŸ§ Tristan's KeepAwake Utility
Tristan's KeepAwake Utility is a lightweight alternative to tools like Caffeine or Mouse Jiggler. It is designed to circumvent security restrictions that disallow .exe or unknown applications by running in PowerShell. 

It operates by preventing your system from sleeping by pressing the unused `F15` key at regular intervals.

## Getting Started

1. **Right-click** `FirstRun.ps1` â†’ **Run with PowerShell**
2. Shortcut `LaunchKeepAwake.lnk` will be created automatically (I did it this way since I could not get Windows to update pre-existing shortcuts with a custom icon. Doing it this way allows you to pin the shortcut wherever you like with the cute icon :D)
3. Use this shortcut going forward
4. KeepAwake will autostart to the system tray. To access its features simply right click the tray icon.

## Features
- Sends `F15` input every 1, 5, or 10 minutes
- Will run silently in the **system tray**
- Ability to **Pause** and temporarily stop inputs
- Requires no install or admin access

## Purpose for Pause?
Some programs (remote terminals, games, keyboard utilities) may react to `F15`.  
Use **Pause** if you experience issues while using your system
